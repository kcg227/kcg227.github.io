# Lehigh Fall 2024 Undergraduate Enrollment by Residency

## Lehigh University Institutional Data Center

### This dataset reflects the composition of Lehigh University’s undergraduate student body based on place of residence. The goal is to provide a clearer understanding of where students are coming from and to highlight demographic patterns in enrollment. The data is reported by the university’s Institutional Data Center and classifies students into four categories. Percentages were calculated based on total undergraduate enrollment, with each category reflecting its share of the overall population.

### Key Findings NY/NJ Residents make up the largest group at 34.6%, demonstrating the university’s strong regional draw from neighboring states. Other States closely follow at 33.8%, showing that Lehigh maintains a broad national reach beyond the immediate region. Local Residents account for 25.0%, indicating that one-quarter of undergraduates come from within or near the Lehigh Valley. International Students represent 6.7%, a smaller but meaningful proportion that contributes to campus diversity.

### Implications
#### The data shows that while Lehigh remains anchored in its regional connections—particularly with New Jersey and New York—it also attracts a significant share of students from across the country. The relatively small but steady international presence underscores opportunities for growth in global recruitment. These trends may guide future admissions strategies, marketing efforts, and resource allocation to ensure that the university continues to balance local commitments with national and international outreach.
