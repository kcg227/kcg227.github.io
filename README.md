# Bethlehem Population 2025


## Population by Race

### Created by Kendall Gavin
### 2025 World Population Review Data Center (https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/pennsylvania/bethlehem?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  



## Background
#### Over the past few decades, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, has seen changes in its population. Changes in the population are a reflection of larger regional trends in economic growth, migration, and cultural diversity. Monitoring the distribution of races and ethnicities offers valuable information about planning priorities, representation, and community needs. There are 80,034 people living in Bethlehem as of 2025.

## Methodology
#### Data was collected from the World Population Review Data Center. Racial/ethnic groupings and population numbers align with the reporting guidelines of the U.S. Census. The percentages were computed as a proportion of the entire projected population in 2025.

## Key Findings
#### 1. The majority of Bethlehem’s population (62.32%) identifies as White
#### 2. People identifying with two or more races (13.72%) and other races (11.29%) make up a significant portion of the city’s population, reflecting increasing diversity.
#### 3. Black or African American residents represent 9.13% of the total population.
#### 4. Asian residents account for 3.26%, while Native American (0.24%) and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (0.04%) populations remain very small.

## Implications
#### These demographic trends demonstrate the increasing racial and ethnic diversity of Bethlehem, which affects housing, healthcare access, education, local government, and cultural representation. This information can be used by community leaders and policymakers to direct resource allocation and inclusive planning.
